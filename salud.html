				<h1>SALUD: Healing Through the Arts</h1>
				
				<p>
					SALUD: Healing Through the Arts develops young community leaders by offering a space for personal 
					expression while exploring the connection between immigration and health.  We hope that through 
					our art, we inspire the general public to participate in addressing issues that affect our entire 
					society. The project is a collaboration between Radio Arte, Latinos Progresando, and the National 
					Museum of Mexican Art, part of the New Routes to Community Health Initiative.
				</p>

				<h2>Radio Arte SALUD Workshops</h2>
				<h3>Health, Mind and Body</h3>
				
				<p>
					SALUD: Healing Through the Arts is a program grounded in the idea that art and media can foster 
					meaningful dialogue and strong connections among diverse groups of individuals. During the summer 
					of 2008, we wrote and produced bilingual radio novelas (radio theater) that address a variety of 
					health concerns in our communities from a youth perspective.  We’ve recently developed a workshop 
					that addresses the central themes of our radio novelas (which you can hear on <a href="http://www.myspace.com/wrtechicago" target="blank">our myspace page</a>). 
					Our goal is to share our knowledge with youth and adults, at schools, community organizations, 
					public events, etc.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Workshops are youth-created and youth-led, bilingual, and can be presented in two parts. Part two of the workshops 
					consists of youth writing, performing, and producing their own short skits in the form of Public Service 
					Announcements (PSAs).  Participants will record their PSAs during the workshop and receive a copy of their 
					work on a CD.  All works will be featured on 90.5 WRTE-FM’, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/wrtechicago" target="blank">Radio Arte's Myspace Page</a>, 
					and the <a href="http://www.newroutes.org/" target="blank">New Routes to Community Health initiative website</a>.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Hormones Gone Wild: Salud, mente y cuerpo (Health, mind & body)</h3>
				<p>
					During this one-hour workshop participants will listen to excerpts from SALUD’S radio novelas, and 
					discuss three topics: mental health, sexuality, and teen dating violence. Issues explored include 
					having healthy relationships, the dating bill of rights, addressing homophobia and sexism, as well 
					as dating violence.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Immigration: Past and present</h3>
				<p>
					This workshop focuses on the roles of immigrants in the United States and their everyday experiences since 
					the nation’s early years. Participants will learn about current immigration issues, the long history of 
					immigration waves to the U.S., and their impact on everyday life. In addition to that, participants will 
					learn the causes of this issue are as they reflect on their own family experiences. Through radio novelas 
					clips, different stories of Latino immigrants at work will be explored as the characters face both adversities 
					and success in the pursuit of the American Dream. It is our belief that communities are healthier when they 
					know their rights, and when they are able to dialogue and discuss pressing issues, such as immigration.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Keeping a Healthy Mind: Stress reduction</h3>
				<p>
					During this workshop, which can be presented in both Spanish or in English, participants will listen to and 
					discuss excerpts from radio novelas with a focus on stress and how it affects the lives of, but not limited 
					to, immigrants. The purpose of the workshop is for the audience to see the similarities between causes of 
					stress in individuals who are immigrants and everyone else. Participants will also engage in two stress 
					reduction activities to learn how to cope with stress in their daily lives. The workshop can be presented 
					to any audience including children, youth, and adults. A stress reduction techniques handout will also be 
					provided.
				</p>
				
				<h3>My Sex Life: Safe sex</h3>
				<p>
					During this workshop, which can be for youth, or youth and adults, participants will talk about what 
					it means to have safe sex and healthy relationships. They will also learn about safe-sex practices, 
					address issues pertaining to LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) youth. It includes 
					interactive activities, as well as discussions based on clips from the radio novelas.
				</p>
				
				<p>

					312-455-9455 x 203. Please note that a suggested $200 contribution can help bring a SALUD workshop to you, 
					and will support our continuing work in the community.
