Currently she is the Director of Youth Training, and mentors young producers in creating relevant programming for the community. When she is not in the studio, she can often be found in the streets of Chicago documenting and participating in protests. Free time filled.
			</p>

Born in Durango, Mexico but raised in Chicago, she has often had to face several cultural barriers but that has also made her more understanding of other cultures and given deeper respect for her own.

			</p>
			<h3>Catalina Maria Johnson</h3>
			<p>
				The host and producer of Beat Latino, Catalina credits her bilingual and bicultural heritage to the tenaciousness of a Mexican mom and a German/Swedish dad. Thanks to them, she grew up between two cities named St. Louis, one in Missouri, and the other, San Luis Potosi, Mexico. The sounds of Beat Latino are infused with a multi-culti Latino perspective, going back to classic recordings as well as looking ahead to emerging sounds, styles, and performers. &iexcl;Viva la m&uacute;sica latina en toda su diversidad, desde sus ra&iacute;ces hasta la vanguardia!
