				<h3>2010 Training Program sneak peak</h3>
				
				<p>
					Radio Arte offers a free one-year training program for youth 17-24 (Winter) in journalism, 
					digital production, broadcasting, and using new media. Participants build up their skills 
					through classes, workshops and hands-on participation in the  production of one of Radio 
					Arte’s flagship public affairs programs (First Voice/Primera Voz, Homofrecuencia, Sin Papeles). 
					These programs air live on 90.5 WRTE-FM.
				</p>

					Radio Arte’s training program is offered in three phases. The first 3 months participants take 
					classes and workshops on the basics of radio journalism, digital production, Federal Communication 
					Commission (FCC) rules and regulations, and reporting on social justice issues.  During the following 
					6 months, participants receive hands-on training in the production of one of Radio Arte’s flagship 
					public affairs programs that air live on 90.5 WRTE-FM. The last 3 months youth develop an 
					independent project, which can include creating a series of audio documentaries, workshops or 
					community forums related their work. After graduation from the training program, participants are 
					eligible to submit a proposal for their own specialty show on Radio Arte, or Radio Arte 2 (HD). In 
					addition, even though we do not offer job placement, we can support the search for internships and 
					available positions in the field.
